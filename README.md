## Tech Index

- This is my personal index to information or links I find interesting.
- I made this as an easy way to keep track of information I am working on or just interested in.
- It is important to be able to write things down to keep track of your progress on a subject and to have the information at your fintertips when you need it.
- I am learning a lot about Markdown because that is what I am using for this index/blog.
