# Camping

When I retire I plan to travel the country in my travel trailer visiting national parks and other interesting places. I have a small trailer now but may upgrade to a bigger one someday. If I get a bigger one I'll bring my two cats, Regina and Stella, with me so they can see the outdoors too.


### My Camper

I have a 2022 Aliner Ranger 10 travel trailer.  It weighs 1445 lbs and the tongue weight is 160 lbs. It is about 5 ft tall in travel mode so it fits easily in my garage and has a low center of gravity when travelling.
