### Angular

### Ansible

### Camping

I have plans to purchase an Aliner Ranger 10 travel trailer and take it around the country. Each place I stop I will get a sticker and put it on my camper. I created a channel on YouTube to share videos from my trips.

My channel is called "Calico Camper" because the stickers I get from each place will make my camper look like a calico cat's fur. I also have two calico cats, Stella and Regina.

Trip ideas:

- Joshua Tree National Park
- Ruidoso, NM
- Florida
- New York
- Portland, Oregan
