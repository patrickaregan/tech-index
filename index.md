### Camping

I have plans to purchase an Aliner Ranger 10 travel trailer and take it around the country. Each place I stop I will get a sticker and put it on my camper. I created a channel on YouTube to share videos from my trips.

My channel is called "Calico Camper" because the stickers I get from each place will make my camper look like a calico cat's fur. I also have two calico cats, Stella and Regina.

Trip ideas:

- Joshua Tree National Park
    * Stop 1: San Angelo KOA in Texas (3.5 hours from Austin)
    * Stop 2: Carlsbad KOA in New Mexico (4.5 hours from San Angelo KOA)
    * Stop 3: Wilcox/Cochise KOA in Arizona (6.5 hours from Carlsbad KOA)
    * Stop 4: Mesa/Apache Junction KOA in Arizona (3 hours from Wilcox KOA)
    * Stop 5: Palm Springs/Joshua Tree KOA in California (5 hours from from Mesa KOA)
