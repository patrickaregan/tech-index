# Airsoft

Airsoft is a sport where people shoot plastic BBs at each other with airguns. It is similar to paintball but there is more emphasis on realism where the guns are concerned.

## Where to get Airsoft Gear

Evike is a great site for airsoft guns and gear. I purchased a CZ P09 replica from them. You can visit them online at [evike.com](https://www.evike.com/airsoft-guns/).

## Where to play in Austin, Texas

I played my first game at Texas Paintball in Jonestown which is northwest of Austin, Texas. You can visit them online at [txpb.com](https://txpb.com/).
